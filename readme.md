# BreakHis Baselines 
* Breast cancer histology slides of size 700X460 pixels from [(BreakHis)](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/breast-cancer-histopathological-database-breakhis/)
* Comparision of traditional ml methods on extracted VGG features (ineffective) are [here](https://github.com/renebidart/breakHis/blob/master/notebooks/final/test_vgg_features_cv.ipynb)
* Transfer learning with Inception V3, Resnet and a visualization [here](https://github.com/renebidart/breakHis/blob/master/notebooks/final/cnn-fine-tuning.ipynb). This worked resonably well, but is unfinished.
